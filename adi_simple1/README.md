# adi_simple1
A very simple instance comprised of one generator node and three consumer nodes.

Existing edges: (G,1);(G,2);(G,3)
Demand for each node = 10
Initial capacity for each edge = 15
Edges considered for establishment: (1,2);(2,3)
Susceptance is 1 across all edges
No backup capacity considered
Failure scenarios include: failure of (G,1) w.p. 0.1, failure of (G,2) w.p. 0.1, failure of (G,2) and (G,3) w.p. 0.05
Total investment cost upper bound is 15
New edge costs 5 and one unit of capacity costs 1
